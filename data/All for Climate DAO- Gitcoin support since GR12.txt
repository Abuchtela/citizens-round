## Grantee Description

🍀 Mission 🍀
All for Climate's mission is to make climate and social justice action as accessible as possible by offering legal, administrative, community and fundraising support. Solving the climate crisis requires the power of a collective action of a diversity of grassroot projects and active citizens. In the past three years we onboarded over 200 collectives in the network, and we raised and distributed nearly 2 million euros directly to where it is needed, on the ground where the action is happening.
🍀 Why Gitcoin matters so much to us 🍀
A lot of the work we do is bringing (financial) resources to grassroots initiatives. No better partner than Gitcoin. We quickly understood what Gitcoin could offer to our network,
Since GR12 (!) - November 2021 - we joined the Gitcoin team. Xavier attended the weekly meetings to create the Climate rounds from the ground up. Afterwards Leen joined, helping out with setting up and organising the first Twitter spaces to showcase projects and put the spotlights on them. We organised them in old school spreadsheets, very early days :-). We not only onboarded as many projects as possible within the All for Climate network, we helped write numerous help pages, did a ton of reviewing of projects behind the scenes and set up our own help hubs in our discord.
About 9 months ago, Marco took over to join the team on behalf of All for Climate. In the alpha rounds we took lead roles in building and engaging the bundles. And although we were not part ourselves in the Beta round, we helped numerous projects to apply and run in the round. Adriana and Day organised twitter spaces in Spanish, to open up to wider communities.
🍀Thank you to Ayowecca 🍀
A big thank you to Ayowecca for nominating us for this round. Ayowecca was indeed, back in the days, one of the project we lifted up by onboarding them in web3. It is wonderful to see how well they are doing.
And as we always say: Active citizens are a public good. 🌱 We better support them in every way we can, our communities and society depends on them 💚

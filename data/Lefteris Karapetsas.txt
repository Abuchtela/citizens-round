## Grantee Description

I am Lefteris Karapetsas. I have been contributing to the gitcoin DAO from its inception and up until April 2023.
Served both as a steward and for a bit in the steward council.
I really appreciate all Gitcoin has done for funding opensource projects. I have many times been a dissenting voice in the forums but always tried to push the DAO towards what I thought was the right thing to do.
I was asked by multiple DAO participants to apply for this round so I am trying this out.

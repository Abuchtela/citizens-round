## Grantee Description:

Regens Unite is a community-building initiative that bridges the gaps between the broad range of sectors working on regenerative solutions, connecting expertise with innovation.
We do this through curated, in-person gatherings with programs designed to guide participants through professionally facilitated discussions and knowledge-sharing experiences. We also produce digital media to share learnings and support a growing regen network.

In Sept 2022 we featured Gitcoin grants round 15 during our Regens Unite Berlin event, inviting our 200 attendees to donate in the active round.

In May 2023 weâ€™ve run two Gitcoin activation events in Berlin and Brussels, inviting our network to come learn about web3 fundraising and specifically learn how to participate in Gitcoin grants rounds.
A broad range of experience levels attended the events - some completely new to web3 without their first wallet, and some with active grants wanting to learn more about best practices for successful fundraising.

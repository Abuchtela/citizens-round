## Grantee Description

Gitcoin Awareness and Female Founder Amplification was a series of conversations, interviews, articles that were driven by Sandra Ponce de Leon to promote female founders participating in the Gitcoin grant process and raise awareness about quadratic funding. Through a multichannel and platform approach, Sandraâ€™s work aimed to foster inclusivity and empower women in web3.
Using organizations she cofounded like More Women in Crypto (now Web3 Women's Nights), the NFT Boutique and multiple platforms such as Grit Daily, the metaverse (NFT Boutiqueverse), Twitter, and LinkedIn, the conversations amplified the voices of female and Latam impact founders, connecting them with a wider audience. She organized virtual and metaverse meetups as well as IRL gatherings for founders to share their experiences, raise awareness about Gitcoin and highlight the significance of quadratic funding. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Gitcoin grants in supporting social impact projects and encourages more participation.
Key outcomes include increased Gitcoin awareness, expanded engagement with female founders and the web3 community, and enhanced fundraising support for impactful projects.
Gitcoin Awareness and Female Founder Amplification leads to a more inclusive and impactful web3 ecosystem, empowering women and leveraging quadratic funding for positive change.

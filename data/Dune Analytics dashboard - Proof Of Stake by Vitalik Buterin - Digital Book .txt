## Grantee Description

I did a Dune Analytics dashboard to promote, track and increase transparency about the marketing of the book "Proof of Stake" from Vitalik Buterin at Gitcoin.
This is the URL of the dashboard:
https://dune.com/ivanmolto/proof-of-stake-buy-vitalik-buterin-book
The main goal of the dashboard was to track any amount of ETH donated to receive an NFT and the digitally signed book from Vitalik.
But other key indicators were also provided such as total ETH donated, number of donations, number of donors, cumulative donations vs ETH donated by hour, range of ETH donated per number of donors, number of donations by hour, ETH donated by hour, number of donations by day, ETH donated by day, and total minting gas costs.
The ETH donated by donors chart was used at

## Grantee Description:

Since September 2022, I have been dedicated to creating value for the Gitcoin ecosystem through community engagement and marketing for Gitcoin grants.
These activities were undertaken without monetary compensation and were part of two main projects: Solarpunk Guild and Impact Academy.
ðŸŒŽ IMPACT ACADEMY
Launched in June 2022, Impact Academy serves as a knowledge and networking hub, enabling new impact project builders to save time and accelerate their learning curve through engaging educational activities. As a project co-founder, my role involved conducting personalized one-on-one impact calls on various topics, including strategic vision, Twitter growth, Gitcoin grants, and more. I personally supported over 20 founders through these personalized impact calls, with a specific focus on Gitcoin grants and their promotion.

ðŸŒŽ SOLARPUNK GUILD
Launched in November 2022, Solarpunk Guild is a collective that provides support for Solarpunk-inspired projects, aiming to unlock the potential of public good funding. As a project co-founder, my primary focus within the guild included the following activities:
Alpha Round 12-hour marathon, which helped raise 2.177 DAI in last-day pledges for small projects and bundles.

Coordination support for Gitcoin Community Radio, hosting two daily slots totaling approximately 20 hours.
Please note that all activities within the guild are collectively run, and I have highlighted the tasks that are particularly relevant to creating value for the Gitcoin ecosystem, where I have invested more time.

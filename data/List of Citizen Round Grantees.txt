The first-ever Citizens Round is now LIVE! A unique opportunity to celebrate and support the unsung heroes who've been integral to @gitcoin's journey.

We're welcoming 33 grantees who are individuals and projects who've made significant contributions through education, informative spaces, data analysis, and essential discord support. The round runs from June 13 12:00 UTC - June 27 23:59 UTC on Optimism

With this round, we're shifting the focus to past accomplishments, not future potentials. This retroQF round spotlights the extraordinary value already being created by our citizens. Don't think about stimulating future work. Instead, let's recognize and reward value created

A matching pool of 20K DAI is ready to amplify your support via Quadratic Funding. Every donation matters and thanks to QF, your donation won’t just be a drop in the ocean– it will create waves

Don't forget!

1. Verify your @gitcoinpassport to activate the matching pool for your donation and prevent Sybil attacks.

2. This round is on Optimism meaning lower gas fees. Make sure to switch to Optimism and transfer ETH for gas fees and donations.

Let’s pay it forward to those who have worked behind the scenes without any expectation of reward, inspiring future innovators. Together, we can create an even stronger  @gitcoin community.

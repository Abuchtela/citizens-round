## Grantee Description

My contributions as a Gitcoin Citizen can be divided into two categories, community support and stewardship:
	1	Community support for Gitcoin on Discord(in the #peer-support channel) starting from 1st of April until the present moment.
	•	I’ve helped and guided at least 100 people around various subjects related to the Gitcoin grants, passport, community, ethos, products, history, methodology and more.
	•	I was one of the first people who noticed that the Guild campaign lead to some errors related to the roles and supported the community until the DAO created a bot to help people out.
	•	Actually started supporting my peers before the Gitcoin Citizen round was announced officially(started on the 1st of April) :D
2.Steward and avid Gitcoin promoter online and IRL. I’ve started in early 2022 and I’m still going. Was the fourth best steward for 2022 according to Gitcoin.
As a steward I’ve always advocated for:
-fairness and transparency around all matters related to Gitcoin DAO, namely it’s products(with an emphasis on the grant program), governance and public relationships/comms
-community education & empowerment
-community support and inclusiveness
	•	the protection of Gitcoin DAO from internal and external threats to it’s success
In 2022 I was one of the recipients of the Outstanding stewards awards. My only interests were the success of Gitcoin DAO and the empowerment of our community via the Allo protocol, Grants Stack, Gitcoin Passport and also the ethos that Gitcoin promotes in web3.

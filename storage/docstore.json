technology. The DAO serves over 500 unique members across various continents and disciplines that come together to form a vibrant ecosystem that uplifts historically excluded voices and develops custom solutions to community care.\nThe DAO currently stewards 3 member-led guilds that focus on art as activism, liberation technology, and our written publication. In addition to these guilds are the projects that each guild creates such as the Renaissance on Chain Movement to onboard overlooked artists into Web3, The LITeracy Hubs Initiative which provides free and discounted internet connectivity services to blighted areas, and the 40acres Monthly Newsletter to give a curated cultural perspective to the world of Web3.\nThe DAO impacts the Web3 community by curating a safe and welcoming experience for diverse participants in the ecosystem. It does this by connecting them with resources, tools, and opportunities built with a culturally centered design to engage them with all aspects of Web3 such as immersive VR/AR experiences that uplift cultural art, training programs that expose emerging industry professionals to the latest languages, protocols, and blockchains, to AI-powered solutions to social issues addressed by our Uhuru Force guild.\nBy supporting 40acres you are providing access to a more distributed internet which allows for further innovation that takes ALL perspectives into account by intentionally including those that have been historically excluded.\n\n## Additional Information\nGrantee Team Size\n52\n", "doc_id": "19941bdc-79d6-4000-a4e4-9df824e1f31e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "cd329eee6d66872bd8943cb16b4e8b34c51672dfea6a085279a1dc21c7625c9f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1841, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "b483941e-1aa7-4dd6-80a9-121978a331cc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8af7f05-6c77-46b3-af3c-437647384f00": {"__data__": {"text": "# Name of the grantee: All for Climate DAO: Gitcoin support since GR12\n\n## Grantee website: https://allforclinmate.earth\n\n## Grantee twitter handle:  @all4climatedao\n\n## Created on: June 4, 2023\n\n## Grantee Description\n\n\ud83c\udf40 Mission \ud83c\udf40\nAll for Climate's mission is to make climate and social justice action as accessible as possible by offering legal, administrative, community and fundraising support. Solving the climate crisis requires the power of a collective action of a diversity of grassroot projects and active citizens. In the past three years we onboarded over 200 collectives in the network, and we raised and distributed nearly 2 million euros directly to where it is needed, on the ground where the action is happening.\n\ud83c\udf40 Why Gitcoin matters so much to us \ud83c\udf40\nA lot of the work we do is bringing (financial) resources to grassroots initiatives. No better partner than Gitcoin. We quickly understood what Gitcoin could offer to our network,\nSince GR12 (!) - November 2021 - we joined the Gitcoin team. Xavier attended the weekly meetings to create the Climate rounds from the ground up. Afterwards Leen joined, helping out with setting up and organising the first Twitter spaces to showcase projects and put the spotlights on them. We organised them in old school spreadsheets, very early days :-). We not only onboarded as many projects as possible within the All for Climate network, we helped write numerous help pages, did a ton of reviewing of projects behind the scenes and set up our own help hubs in our discord.\nAbout 9 months ago, Marco took over to join the team on behalf of All for Climate. In the alpha rounds we took lead roles in building and engaging the bundles. And although we were not part ourselves in the Beta round, we helped numerous projects to apply and run in the round. Adriana and Day organised twitter spaces in Spanish, to open up to wider communities.\n\ud83c\udf40Thank you to Ayowecca \ud83c\udf40\nA big thank you to Ayowecca for nominating us for this round. Ayowecca was indeed, back in the days, one of the project we lifted up by onboarding them in web3. It is wonderful to see how well they are doing.\nAnd as we always say: Active citizens are a public good. \ud83c\udf31 We better support them in every way we can, our communities and society depends on them \ud83d\udc9a\n\n## Additional Information\nGrantee Team Size\n7\n", "doc_id": "e8af7f05-6c77-46b3-af3c-437647384f00", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "33bf607014fdcb5ad9ba65f285a8c1c61e6018861756a99599ec160b1a0e7ddb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2322, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "f7196017-981b-4f78-b72b-0d6291360b43"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c69410fd-77e9-413b-807d-f5780673c02f": {"__data__": {"text": "# Name of the grantee: Archimedes' Lever\n\n## Grantee website: https://bhau.gitbook.io/archimedes-lever-1/\n\n## Grantee twitter handle: @bhau_jagmd\n\n## Created on: April 2, 2023rd\n\n## Grantee Github: jagtapper\n\n## Grantee Description\n\nThe Archimedes' Lever developed from the Neuroscience of Ethereum (https://bounties.gitcoin.co/grants/7514/neuroscience-of-ethereum-decentralized-science-fo) during the inaugural Gitcoin Grants Decentralized Science #DeSci Round. A very big thank you to all supporters of such innovative ideas that cannot grow and impact the world in the realms of Traditional Academia.\nThis project is about restoring the Spirit of Science and directing it towards the intended purpose of the Scientific Process - Discovery of Truth. Today, Governance over the Scientific Process is misdirected towards proving that which is desired to be established as truth, for the purposes of control and profits by 3rd parties. This can be summarized by Goodhart's Law:\n\"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\"\nThe Scientific Process is driven by the motive to gather evidence against the null hypothesis in order to disprove it, consequently lending credence to the hypothesis in mind. The inverse is ubiquitous. The Scientific Process is heavily influenced by Ego Bias - the self-oriented drive to extract value for oneself at the expense of others; the opposite of Public Good.\nThis is fundamentally causally related to the plethora of global problems humanity faces today; therefore, we must facilitate the widespread adoption of Decentralized Science #DeSci\nThis project aims to Apply Archimedes' Insights by symbolically deploying the Archimedes Lever, so as to onboard the next wave of users to web3. Innovations in Money, Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Governance, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Decentralized Identity, and Hybrid Applications will be integrated to create and deliver Value for web3 citizens - for We, the People.\nThis project is for those who believe the IMPOSSIBLE is POSSIBLE - to those who believe in the Infinite Garden & the Infinite Machine; to everyone who is here to uncover & discover Truth; to us all who live to unlock the untapped potential of Decentralized Science #DeSci - to the ground shakers & the Earth Movers - LFG \ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80\nStay Hungry; Stay Foolish \ud83e\udd2a\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude0e\n\n## Additional Information\nGrantee Team Size\n3\n", "doc_id": "c69410fd-77e9-413b-807d-f5780673c02f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d34109cf6aca9e77a1ee6df119a8230358f73a1a4e1a87470ab871b8bfd85099", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2389, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "df87d184-61b6-48d9-b169-0c87982f920c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6bb18ac-eea5-4abb-b591-27236704c2db": {"__data__": {"text": "# Name of the grantee: Bankless Academy\n\n## Grantee website: https://app.banklessacademy.com\n\n## Grantee twitter handle: @banklessacademy\n\n## Created on: May 29th, 2023\n\n## Grantee Github: didierkrux\n\n## Grantee Github: BanklessDAO\n\n## Grantee Description\n\nBankless Academy is a leading web3 \"knowledge on-ramp\" - a practical & engaging education experience with infrastructure preparing to be scaled across the blockchain multiverse.\nWe're helping the world adopt the permissionless tools they need to\u00a0go Bankless.\nWe have worked closely with the\u00a0Gitcoin Passport\u00a0team on integration, feedback & promotion:\n\t1\tEarly integration of Gitcoin Passport into Bankless Academy\n\t2\tGitcoin Passport\u00a0case study\u00a0article\u00a0https://twitter.com/gitcoin/status/1633547547192213506\n\t3\tAnalysis of the case study with the new Gitcoin Passport Scorer API\n\t4\tPR for a filtered view on Gitcoin Passport (can be used by other communities)\u00a0https://passport.gitcoin.co/?filter=bankless-academy#/dashboard\n\t5\tEarly feedback on the Scorer API & Gitcoin Passport UX\n\t6\tPromoting the latest Scorer API infrastructure\n\n## Additional Information\nGrantee Team Size\n3\n", "doc_id": "d6bb18ac-eea5-4abb-b591-27236704c2db", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c182dde5111886f3f39334d4f13120d0cf9304a05a2e2c7e1d158efae796fb5a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1136, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "e4c9a79f-dc4e-4afc-a2d0-35d1ea0b88e7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "bcc78473-5f62-4b1b-bc95-6be05886a117": {"__data__": {"text": "# Name of the grantee: Bankless Hindi\n\n## Grantee website: https://linktr.ee/banklesshi\n\n## Grantee Twitter handle: @BanklessH\n\n## Created on: June 4th, 2023\n\n## Grantee Description\n\nThe Bankless Hindi project is an branch of the BanklessDAO community.

We want to shed light on the efforts of the dedicated DeSci (Decentralized Science) Round Operators around and during the first\u00a0DeSci round\u00a0on the new Gitcoin Grants Program.

They spearheaded the strategic planning and organization of the entire grants round, ensuring that it aligns with the principles of open science and advances the growth of decentralized scientific knowledge on the Web3 stack. In collaboration with the community, they defined eligibility criteria for this round. We believe that the many hours dedicated to this round by the round operators has helped establish a stronger self-directed DeSci ecosystem where rounds are run by the community, for the community.\nCommunity Engagement and Outreach\nThe DeSci Round Operators engaged the Gitcoin community and beyond. They passionately spread awareness about the grants round, emphasizing the importance of decentralized science and its potential to address many of the problems which plague modern science. They actively sought out diverse voices, reaching out to researchers, developers, and enthusiasts worldwide, encouraging them to participate and contribute their unique ideas and skills to the cause. By fostering a strong community bond, they created an environment that nurtured innovation; collaboration in the realm of Decentralized Science, Regenerative Finance and Decentralized Space ecosystems.\nGrant Evaluation and Selection\nTasked with reviewing submitted projects and ensuring adherence to the eligibility criteria and quality of submissions, our DeSci Round Operators diligently evaluated the submitted applications. They applied their expertise and extensive knowledge to ensure the selection process was fair, equitable, and aligned with the core principles of the Decentralized Science Grants Round. As part of the payout process, the DeSci round operators will be publishing a summary of the review process for transparency and to help future round stewards better define eligibility criteria and conduct reviews.\nApproved:\u00a065 projects\nRejected:\u00a018 projects\nGrant Management and Support\nBeyond the selection process, the DeSci Round Operators continued to play an active role in managing and supporting the grantees. By moderating a dedicated telegram channel for the community, they ensured the DeSci grantees were able to have their questions and concerns answered directly by the Operators team. They provided guidance and mentorship, to grant recipients all along the grant application process, helping them navigate the challenges of using the beta version of the grants stack. By offering ongoing support, they aimed to ensure that every voice within our community felt heard.\nFacilitating the DeSci Round\nThe DeSci Round Operators played a crucial role in finalizing a suitable grants round with the matching pool funds available from\u00a0MoonDAO, GreenPill China, and previous DeSci sponsors. They meticulously worked to create an environment that encouraged generous contributions to support the Decentralized Science Grants Round\u00a0view on Etherscan.

Through a multichannel and platform approach, Sandra\u2019s work aimed to foster inclusivity and empower women in web3.\nUsing organizations she cofounded like More Women in Crypto (now Web3 Women's Nights), the NFT Boutique and multiple platforms such as Grit Daily, the metaverse (NFT Boutiqueverse), Twitter, and LinkedIn, the conversations amplified the voices of female and Latam impact founders, connecting them with a wider audience. She organized virtual and metaverse meetups as well as IRL gatherings for founders to share their experiences, raise awareness about Gitcoin and highlight the significance of quadratic funding. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Gitcoin grants in supporting social impact projects and encourages more participation.\nKey outcomes include increased Gitcoin awareness, expanded engagement with female founders and the web3 community, and enhanced fundraising support for impactful projects.\nGitcoin Awareness and Female Founder Amplification leads to a more inclusive and impactful web3 ecosystem, empowering women and leveraging quadratic funding for positive change.\n\n## Additional Information\nGrantee Team Size: \n2\n", "doc_id": "de02000e-39ab-489d-bb5a-2aa0840428d5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0bb69225079d9ced3bab340dddff301f2e42ba2c7acaa32a05ed77d271be8c10", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1692, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "6d384918-1b77-428f-8fce-08774d634db4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a62d513b-6887-449f-8563-295174da8ef6": {"__data__": {"text": "## Summary\n\nGitcoin is the world\u2019s largest implementer of quadratic funding. We have run 105 quadratic funding rounds, helped fund over 3,700 projects, and grown ecosystems like Uniswap, Polygon, and ENS. Yet, we aren\u2019t currently using quadratic funding ourselves. With the recent launch of the Allo protocol, Gitcoin should be one of the first ecosystems to use the protocol to fund its shared needs.\n\nThis proposal is to pilot a series of quadratic funding rounds for rewarding efforts supporting the Gitcoin Community, specifically by [Gitcoin Citizens](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Citizen-Resource-Hub-7b83f9b5ca06487f84e0142d0180970a). Citizens are value-aligned community members who are eager to contribute their time and skills in service of the DAO. Running these rounds will lower the barrier of entry for contributing to the DAO, determine what the community values most, and help test (dogfood) the Allo protocol.\n\nFor this we are requesting a total of $95K in GTC from the Gitcoin treasury, more details below.*\n\n## Abstract\n\nThrough using our protocol and products, we\u2019ll be able to better understand what works and what could be improved from both a funding and technology perspective.\n\nIn particular, we\u2019ll be able to test two different approaches to quadratic funding: normal QF and retroQF. Normal QF (the kind we see in Grants Rounds) can fund both completed and planned work, while RetroQF exclusively funds work which has already had an observable impact. Because of this, RetroQF may be better at distributing funds according to the value actually created by a contribution but is not suited to situations where contributors can\u2019t afford to wait for compensation. We will try both methods to gain information about which is better suited to the unique needs of our community.\n\nBy running different styles of rounds repeatedly and quickly, we\u2019ll be able to gain valuable insight into how to best fund grantees, improve our products, and empower our community. We will also identify what contributions our community finds valuable so that in subsequent rounds people have more information when choosing what to work on.\n\nIt is also our hope, that by running these rounds, we can reward Gitcoin Citizens like[ Carl who evaluated Grantee Impact](https://twitter.com/carl_cervone/status/1616792961412640772),[ Carlos who created a video guide for donating to Gitcoin on mobile](https://twitter.com/web3beach/status/1617509775415324672),[ Jon Ruth who spent countless hours answering questions in discord, and more](https://twitter.com/krrisis/status/1616637568992296960?s=20) (these are cherry-picked examples of many voluntary contributions).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is motivated by[ recent posts from Scott Moore](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-building-gitcoin-using-quadratic-funding-for-subtraction/13015)[ and Kevin Olsen](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/refactoring-gitcoin-what-falls-between-the-cracks/13026) encouraging Gitcoin to build Gitcoin using QF. A huge thank you to them!\n\nThere are three main reasons why we should try this.\n\n1. To gain experience using quadratic funding and the allo protocol to build our own ecosystem, demonstrate effectiveness, and identify areas for improvement.\n\nIn particular, many Gitcoin Citizens will experience for the first time what it\u2019s like to create a grant and raise funding. By dogfooding, we will build empathy for our users and increase our ability to help them. For example, if grantees face inconsistency in how much funding they receive each round we will understand this better by experiencing it ourselves.\n\n2. To experiment with a supplementary budgeting process that has greater accountability and less administrative", "doc_id": "a62d513b-6887-449f-8563-295174da8ef6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "88732a8276b325733c8a5550f5a890c99684206b3edb6f9f721a780f879ab553", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3703, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "164901a3-42cf-4464-88b5-dc1360983a45", "3": "9d33861a-8858-4007-b455-130b5d025a42"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d33861a-8858-4007-b455-130b5d025a42": {"__data__": {"text": "experiment with a supplementary budgeting process that has greater accountability and less administrative overhead.\n\nQF creates greater accountability by requiring the support of the community which requires being transparent about what you\u2019re working on.\n\nFurther, there have been many recent conversations about how demanding the quarterly budgeting process currently is. One of the flavors of funding we will experiment with is retroactive quadratic funding. This method does not require extensive proposals, only proof that valuable work has been done.\n\n3. To increase community engagement and participation at all levels of Gitcoin from contribution to governance\n\nQF facilitates inclusion of emerging talents within the Gitcoin community by reducing the barriers to entry. This program enables individuals to receive payment from the DAO without the need to be hired by a workstream. By providing funding quickly, regularly, and with short feedback loops, we expect to see far greater participation from Gitcoin Citizens to support the community itself and in the long run to support the development of Gitcoin itself.\n\nMoreover, QF and especially retro QF can recognize the value of contributions that benefit Gitcoin in ways that aren\u2019t traditionally compensated. This may, for example, include well-considered comments in our governance forum that lead to better governance practices.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nWe expect to run three quadratic funding rounds on the Grants Stack. After each round we will evaluate the results, survey the community, and complete a post-mortem. This is our current best approximation of timing:\n\n* The first round will be retroQF and run immediately after the Gitcoin Beta Rounds in Mid May to set the tone for Citizen engagement. We hope this will also encourage increased engagement during the Beta rounds to help make them as successful as possible.\n* The second round will run Mid June and will be a normal quadratic funding round. This will be a great dogfooding round because this is the type of round our partners are used to running. It will also provide us a good basis for comparing the effectiveness of retroQF.\n* The third round will be about a month after the second and the exact format will depend on the results of the first two rounds.\n\n**Milestones & Timeline:** \n\n| Phase      | Task                                             | Date        |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Phase I    | Send the Draft to stakeholders                   | March 09th  |\n|            | Validate assumptions with stakeholders            | March 17th  |\n|            | Draft posted on the forum                         | March 24th  |\n|            | Community feedback session                        | March 24-28 |\n|            | Update and move to snapshot                       | March 29th  |\n| Phase II   | Round Preparation and Set-Up                      | April 1 - May 15 |\n|            | Gitcoin Citizens Round #1                         | May 16 - 30 |\n|            | Round post mortem                                 | June 1     |\n| Phase III  | Gitcoin Citizens Round #2      ", "doc_id": "9d33861a-8858-4007-b455-130b5d025a42", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "382bb5d4459ff8e54882b1a656f1a2c3b8c3f3adf90646c810d39697e767b5b1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3611, "end": 6787, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "164901a3-42cf-4464-88b5-dc1360983a45", "2": "a62d513b-6887-449f-8563-295174da8ef6", "3": "1bb3d790-6ea2-4df0-b07d-22a3878376d5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bb3d790-6ea2-4df0-b07d-22a3878376d5": {"__data__": {"text": "Phase III  | Gitcoin Citizens Round #2                         | June 15?   |\n|            | Round post mortem                                 | June 30    |\n|            | Gitcoin Citizens Round #3 (during a round)        | July 15?   |\n|            | Post-project evaluation form (AAR) posted         | July 30th  |\n\n\nNote: the exact and final timing will to be confirmed\n\n**Budget**\n\nCost of Matching Pool Funds:\n\n* $25k per round x 3 rounds = $75k (requested in GTC)*\n\nStaffing:\n  * $20K covering 3 part time contributors working over a period of 20 weeks, requested in GTC.*\n\n| Name  | PI       | PII      | PIII     | \n|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Umar  | 10% FTE (4 weeks)  | 10% FTE (8 weeks) | 10% FTE (8 weeks) |\n| Shawn | 10% FTE (4 weeks)  | 10% FTE (8 weeks) | 10% FTE (8 weeks) |\n| Kris  | 10% FTE (4 weeks)  | 10% FTE (8 weeks) | 10% FTE (8 weeks) |\n\n\n\n\n**Note: After each round we will evaluate the results to determine how we want to adjust for the next round. Hours of contributors are also based on our best guesses and will be validated as we cycle forward. Contributors will keep track of their actual hours, which can be shared with CSDO and Stewards on request. The fact that this is a new experiment may mean that after two rounds we send funding back to the DAO if we decide not to run a third round or request additional funding to expand the round.*\n\n**Funding Eligibility**\n\nThe range of contributions that could be funded this way is purposefully broad and up to the community to define in the long term. However, for the initial rounds we encourage a high focus on community engagement-focused work contributing directly to Gitcoin\u2019s [\u2018most important things\u2019](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s17-musing-gitcoins-most-important-thing/12875) and our [Purpose and Essential Intents.](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/update-gitcoindaos-adopted-purpose-and-essential-intents/10984). Without our community there is no reason for Gitcoin to exist, we are in service of our users, so we want to reward the people who support our grantees and donors through straightforward educational content, data analysis, and support-oriented initiatives.\n\nMore detailed criteria will be communicated before the start of the actual round(s).\n\n**Retroactive Funding.**\n\nRetroactive funding reduces risk and barriers to entry. It takes the guesswork out of deciding what will be valuable to fund because the impact is observable. Anyone can simply work on what they want to work on and they will be funded if the community finds it valuable. For this reason, it is important for contributors to be public about what they\u2019re working on and for us to run frequent rounds with quick feedback loops.\n\nFor the first round we imagine a high focus on grassroots projects run by individuals, our [Gitcoin Citizens](https://gitcoin.notion.site/DAO-Citizen-Resource-Hub-7b83f9b5ca06487f84e0142d0180970a). Contributions which have already been compensated (for example through a WS) will not be eligible.\n\nStarting with retroactive funding showcases to the community how we believe Gitcoin can fund Gitcoin.

I am a world citizen born in France that has the deep honor to learn and live among Indigenous communities from South America and mainly Brazilian Amazonia for 8 years.\nFrom this journey, I have been invited to co-create different projects focusing on\u00a0Indigenous autonomy to maintain their cultures alive but also share their solutions and voices to the world.\nOne of the main and capital topics that appeared on this path is\u00a0the potential of digital and web3 tools in connection to Indigenous rights and cultures so as to create cross-cultural positive ecosystems for global changes.\nThat is why, with Mycelia, we want to bring more Indigenous Voices in Gitcoin Community.\nTLDR;\n\t\u2022\tDue to language and access questions, Indigenous Communities are underrepresented in Web3 and the Gitcoin Community;\n\t\u2022\tFor the 1st Mycelia Gitcoin Round, we succeeded to welcome and translate the participation of Indigenous representative of 6 ethnic groups of Brazil on the Gitcoin Radio to share their visions and experiences with digital and web3 tools;\n\t\u2022\tMany Indigenous representatives asked to join and keep on the initiative towards the creation of IndigenousWeb3 radio and Indigenous projects on Gitcoin;\n\t\u2022\tCreating contents and proper spaces so they can feel empowered and at ease to connect with the Web3 & Gitcoin community;\nBackground Projects\nAfter articulating for few years\u00a0FlorestaTV, a decentralized, community driven TV which initiated from the request of several Indigenous Tribes of the Amazon forest to have a proper space, tools and appropriate qualification so as to share the voice of their\u00a0original cultures, languages, solutions, ways of life and mindset in the digital world from their own worlds and eyes, I recently participated to the foundation of\u00a0Mycelia: a project with the main focus to\u00a0bring more agency to indigenous peoples by promoting Web3 technologies and decentralized Indigenous organizations.\nTo know more about Mycelia :\u00a0https://linktr.ee/mycelia\nMYCELIA & GITCOIN\nIn April 2023, Mycelia participated for the first time in a Gitcoin Round, in the Climate Solutions Round and the featured Metacrisis Round.\nBeyond the success of this first campaign for Mycelia, what was most important for us was the warm and positive welcome we received for\u00a0inviting and translating indigenous guests within the Gitcoin Radio live by the Solarpunk Guild.\nThus, in less than a week we have been\u00a0co-hosting spaces with Indigenous guests of 6 different ethnic groups and profiles (Indigenous criptowarriors, videomakers, digital influencers, decentralized organization makers, healers \u2026), opening the debates to broader way of seeing the realities, global challenges, technologies and projects coordination and explaining the relevance of quadratic funding to fundpublic goods.\n\n\n\nDuring the campaign, we also created\u00a0 a video (in EN/PO/SP) to explain our community how to create a Gitcoin passport and support the campaign:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEyZXLDP04&t=5s, something we want to do more for each campaign to onboard indigenous peoples.\nFrom the 02 to 04.06.2023, we have been invited with Indigenous guests of 5 ethnic groups of Brazil engaged in Indigenous NFTs projectsto present Mycelia on the main stage of the 1st International NFT Event in Brazil (NFT Brazil 2023). A presentation in which we presented Gitcoin as an example of aligned tool to empower Indigenous Communities with Web3.\u00a0Something that we also want to do more, both in Digital and physical events.\n\n\nThis cross-cultural initiatives alongside and complimentary to Mycelia is important to include the latin Indigenous diversity who are", "doc_id": "df5e0e65-f2b1-4b6c-b433-18338189e8e6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5d6ba4076f33d9f3d9891e33ef0a7bf4eb152bc7fde50db3396b3e77cc0a21fd", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3958, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "85ad8a3e-a6e0-4e79-99cf-e031324836a3", "3": "170ec928-223e-46ae-810f-2f227f5c8e59"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "170ec928-223e-46ae-810f-2f227f5c8e59": {"__data__": {"text": "and complimentary to Mycelia is important to include the latin Indigenous diversity who are part of the most disadvantaged communities relative to digital tools.

We hope Gitcoin may integrate this review protocol with the Grants Stack as the project evolves.\nHere is a poem ChatGPT wrote about battling POAP hunters.\n\n\n## Additional Information\nGrantee Team Size: \n1\n", "doc_id": "feaac33f-6de8-47a8-bf39-33ef5d42b162", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bf8d552f0e7bce3ae58c1ed22c1a8e817ce856fde069eb37b736da8d7383ced7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1420, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "386e4545-761e-4e79-a24c-e9e30bd386f7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bb16fd6-d0d4-45fd-9197-ffcfcf074ec1": {"__data__": {"text": "# Name of the grantee: Kairos Research\n\n## Grantee website: https://kairosresearch.xyz\n\n## Grantee Twitter handle: @research_kairos\n\n## Created on: June 3, 2023\n\n## Grantee Github: KairosResearch\n\n## Grantee Description:\n\nKairos Research is a platform dedicated to analyzing web3 technologies and providing valuable resources to Spanish speakers.\nOur mission is to simplify blockchain technology, reduce language barriers, and empower individuals to make informed decisions.

This vision reveals that crypto gives us coordination superpowers.\nI believe that for the regenerative mission to succeed, we must amplify positive-sum stories that are informative, fun, and accessible to all.\nOverview\nAs a former Creative Director with Gitcoin, my art helped fundraise over half a million dollars for the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool since 2021. My focus on regen fiction has now shifted to cultivating the OpenLore Library*, a database of web3 lore, stories, and memes. In the project I am proposing, Moloch, Ether\u2019s Phoenix, and the Dark Forest are just the beginning of a new, uplifting mythology.\nCrypto is at a critical inflection point. Your choice to invest in this project will help realize a positive-sum future for the following reasons:\n\t\u2022\tThe next billion crypto users need inspiring and informative stories to guide them through the cryptoverse. Newcomers consistently fall for the same schemes and OGs can do a better job of passing along the wisdom of past cycles. OpenLore mythology features relatable characters and worlds that orient and guide new adventurers through the cryptoverse.\n\t\u2022\tOpenLore mirrors reality. Every entry in the library (characters, technology, and environments) also represents a powerful force in the real world.\n\t\u2022\tNew settlers are not the only people confused about web3; many crypto elders are still unaware that \u201cEthereum isn\u2019t here to make you rich, Ethereum is here to set you free\" (Vitalik Buterin). Beliefs motivate behavior and it is essential we make Ethereum\u2019s vision clear and attractive.\n\t\u2022\tPublic goods awareness needs to increase in the NFT space. The NFT community has an outsized impact on how the world perceives crypto but our PFP frens are generally oblivious to the regen way. The Gitcoin x MetaLabels drop, Creature World collaboration, and PublicNouns projects have made promising headway and the OpenLore Library is the next step to trojan horse our regen crypto values.\n\t\u2022\tFor those of us already Greenpilled: OpenLore represents a celebration of the adventures that have brought us here\u2013and an inspiring vision of what we hope to buidl together next.\nSpecifications\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s vision of the Infinite Garden inspired me to build the Infinite Garden Trading Card Game. The Infinite Garden TCG recently received seed funding from Gitcoin [GCP-006].\nFunding from this quadratic grant will go to fund the public library of OpenLore. More characters, environments, and artifacts that represent the most significant corners of our wild web3 adventure.\nBio:\nAs a Creative Director with Gitcoin, my art helped fundraise over half a million dollars for the Gitcoin Grants Matching Pool since 2021. Ethereum\u2019s culture and values are central to my creative work and I have continued to dedicate my art sales to funding social causes.

You can read more here.\u00a0\n\nSubmission of projects starts on May 15th\n\nWith this first round we will focus exclusively on rewarding projects which happened in the past, i.e we will use retroactive quadratic funding. This method does not require extensive proposals, only proof that valuable work has been done. Projects should prove the impact they had on the community, by adding as much data available as possible, e.g. listeners of space, reference to posts written and number of likes and views. The more data available, the easier it is for the community to evaluate impact.\u00a0\n\nThe purpose of this document is to outline the general eligibility policy that all grants must meet in order to qualify for acceptance.\n\nEvaluations are done by the core team, and all applicants will be contacted after submission. If a submission is not accepted, the team will provide a reason.\u00a0\n\nCitizen Round-Specific Eligibility Policies\n\n\t\u2022\tAwarded projects & people should have a high focus on community engagement and contribute directly to Gitcoin\u2019s \u2018most important things\u2019\u00a0 and our Purpose and Essential Intents. We intend to reward projects that primarily focus on improving Gitcoin\u2019s community experience. The Grants proposal should explicitly outline how this project supported the Gitcoin Community. Some (non-exhaustive) examples of topics:\u00a0\n\n\t\u2022\teducational content, eg. a guide on how to donate on our platform\u00a0\n\t\u2022\tpromotional content, eg running a twitter space to cover our rounds\n\t\u2022\tdata analysis, eg. a data analysis of previous donations\n\t\u2022\tsupport-oriented initiative, eg. helping out users in our discord\u00a0\n\n\t\u2022\tContributions cannot have been compensated or expect to receive compensation outside of this round.\n\n\t\u2022\tTeam efforts must be submitted as one team submission, not as several individual grants.\n\n\t\u2022\tOnly applications on Gitcoin Builder will be able to be funded. However, the community can nominate others on our forum.\u00a0\n\n\t\u2022\tProjects must be at least 2 weeks old at the date of submission. Newer projects should establish themselves and submit to the next round.\n\nGitcoin Program General Eligibility Policy\nThis policy is set and enforced by the PGF workstream of Gitcoin and is ratified by the Gitcoin stewards. Projects must meet the following criteria:\n\t\u2022\tVerified Github (if applicable) and/or Twitter account\n\nAdditionally, the following are not permitted in Gitcoin-operated rounds:\n\t\u2022\tHateful Content - No racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful speech, no discrimination\n\t\u2022\tDeceiving Users - Malicious content that could cause harm or unintended consequences to users\n\t\u2022\tFalsification - Any type of hacking to falsify a contribution is prohibited. No encouraging or enabling Sybil attacks or other forms of malicious manipulation of the grants platform or the Gitcoin community\n\t\u2022\tFraud & Impersonation - Claiming to be a brand or person you are not.
